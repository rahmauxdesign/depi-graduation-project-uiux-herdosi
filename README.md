# Herdosi – Farm & Livestock Management Platform (UI/UX Design)

## Project Description
Herdosi is a UI/UX design graduation project that focuses on managing livestock farms through a unified digital platform (mobile app and website).

The project aims to help farm managers and owners efficiently track livestock, manage health and feeding, organize grazing areas, monitor equipment, and oversee financial and profitability aspects — all in one place.  
The platform also includes task management and smart reminders to support daily farm operations.

## Problem Statement
Managing livestock farms is a complex process that involves tracking animals, monitoring health and nutrition, managing grazing lands, maintaining equipment, and handling financial operations.

Currently, many farm managers rely on manual methods or disconnected tools, which leads to:
- Lack of accurate tracking for livestock and health records  
- Difficulty managing feeding schedules and grazing plans  
- Poor organization of daily tasks and responsibilities  
- Limited visibility into farm expenses and profitability
